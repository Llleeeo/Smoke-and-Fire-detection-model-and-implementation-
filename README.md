Cigarette smoking is a significant public-health issue, which has numerous negative impacts on health consequences such as cancer and heart disease. In addition, the fire risk is associated with smoking: discarded cigarette butts and smoldering ashes are a common ignition for residential fire. Therefore, our project aimed to develop a cigarette smoking detection model using YOLOv5 architecture. In this report, we will analyze our project process and results and provide improvement of the model. This repository contains the code for tracking and detecting fires and smokes in real-time video using YOLOv5. The project uses a pre-trained YOLOv5 model to identify the presence of fire and smoke in a given video frame and track it through subsequent frames.

My implementation is only for reference, you could use your own image dataset as well as creating datasets on roboflow.
